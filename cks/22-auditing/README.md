### Auditing

#### Stages
* RequestReceived - as soon as audit handler receives the request
* ResponseStarted - once headers are sent (ex: watch)
* ResponseComplete - response body completed
* Panic - events generated when a panic occured  

#### Levels
* None - don't log
* Metadata - log request metadatas
* Request - log request metadatas + request body
* RequestResponse - log request metadata + request & response body

=> first matching rule !
